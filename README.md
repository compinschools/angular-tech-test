# AngularTechTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Notes

I have tested this in chrome with CORS turned off (as it will not pull the data from the API otherwise). You can do this by running: 

`"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="c:/chromedev\"`

I have used tailwind and Material UI for styling. 

I have removed unit tests as it would take a little longer to get them working with CORS disabled via Chrome.

I have not done pagination as there was no documentation on the API for that, but it could be implemented quite simply I would have thought. 

I have spent a couple of hours on this just to satisfy some of the optional requirements as I found it enjoyable!
